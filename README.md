🏥 MediBridge: Bringing Healthcare to Rural Doorsteps
MediBridge is a web platform built to turn local medical stores—especially in rural and underserved regions—into full-fledged community healthcare hubs. It addresses critical gaps in access to medication and medical consultation for people who:

Live far from hospitals or clinics

Are unable to use smartphones or apps due to literacy or digital barriers

🎯 Core Goals:
Empower pharmacists to act as a bridge between patients and doctors.

Enable rural patients to consult with certified doctors through the pharmacist’s device (telemedicine).

Assist non-literate users by having store staff help them navigate medicine availability, appointments, and prescriptions.

Create a network of connected pharmacies that can collectively manage inventory and service requests for remote areas.

💡 How It Works:
Patient walks into a nearby medical store

Pharmacist uses MediBridge to:

Connect with doctors via video/audio consultation

Check and provide required medications

Help with digital prescriptions and follow-ups

If needed, patients can be referred to clinics/hospitals digitally
